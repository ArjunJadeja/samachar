## Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- **Minimum SDK level 26**
- [**Kotlin**](https://kotlinlang.org/) - Modern, concise, and safe programming language.
- [**Dagger Hilt**](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - Dagger Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project.
- [**Kotlin Serialization**](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) - A compiler plugin that automatically produces visitor code for classes, and a runtime library that uses generated code to serialize objects without reflection.
- [**Coroutines**](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) - Asynchronous or non-blocking programming is an important part of the development landscape. Coroutines is our recommended solution for asynchronous programming on Android.
- [**Flow**](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/) - An asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values and completes normally or with an exception.
- [**Retrofit**](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- [**RoomDB**](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) - The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
- [**Jetpack Compose**](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose) - Jetpack Compose is Androidâ€™s recommended modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android.
- [**Coil**](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/) - An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.
- [**Material 3**](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Material design components for building View layouts and Animations.
